## The collection includes

* [`PhpGpcVarsMiddleware`](src/PhpGpcVarsMiddleware.php) Extract PSR-7 request data to PHP GPC variables `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE` and `$_SERVER`
* [`PhpSessionMiddleware`](src/PhpSessionMiddleware.php) Read sesion cookie from PSR-7 requests and add session cookie to PSR-7 responses
